Hello, my name is mosaad ahmed mohammed, I am from india .I did my undergraduate in computer science and now I am here to pursue my masters degree in computer science as well. experience that i have with software testing and Quality assurance is that when i worked for two years in a product based company after my undergrad back in india. My role was associate software engineer where i had to create ETL data pipelines to transfer the financial data of the company from one location to another and do all the manupilations in between. I used to create those pipelines using python scripts and for testing purpose we didn't have a separate QA team to test it but we had two different environments such as development and UAT, where we used to deploy our code and test it first in development and then in UAT environments and finally if it runs successfully then it gets moved to production environment. If we find any issue or error in any of the two environments , we make the necessary changes in the code and deploy it again from the first environment. The goals i have from this course i would say would be to gain a better understanding of software testing methodologies and also the practices to be followed to ensure the overall quality is maintained while working on a project. the job goal i have after getting this degree would be to do something on the development side as i am from coding background, so yeah i would look for software developer roles after i get my degree
